CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-1056] Clock 'clk_in' completely overrides clock 'sys_clk_pin'.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 [get_ports clk_in], [/home/lpez/t-crest/reconfig/build/nexys4ddr-recon/sources/hdl/clk_manager/clk_manager.xdc:56]
Previous: create_clock -period 10.000 -name sys_clk_pin -waveform {0.000 5.000} -add [get_ports clk_in], [/home/lpez/t-crest/reconfig/build/nexys4ddr-recon/sources/xdc/nexys4ddr.xdc:8]
Resolution: Review the constraint files and remove the redundant clock definition(s). If the clock constraints are not saved in a file, you can first save the constraints to an XDC file and reload the design once the constraints have been corrected.
