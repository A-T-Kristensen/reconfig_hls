RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 patmos_inst_0/core/dcache/sc/MemBlock_1/mem_reg has an input control pin patmos_inst_0/core/dcache/sc/MemBlock_1/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[7] (net: patmos_inst_0/core/dcache/sc/MemBlock_1/ADDRBWRADDR[3]) which is driven by a register (recon_buffer_comp/ocp_to_bram_comp_0/SResp_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
