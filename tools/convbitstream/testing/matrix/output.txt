Description: Bitstreams for generating results for the bsc thesis of Andreas.

Parameters:
  - datasize = 32
  - compression = enabled
  - bitswapped = enabled

There are 8 bitfile/s to process.

Processing bitfile 1 of 8:
  - id = recon_matmul_3b_4x4_pblock
  - file = ./sample_bitstream/recon_matmul_3b_4x4_pblock.bin
  - raw bitfile size = 458980 bytes
  - 32-bit based entropy = 2.386270 bit
  - optimum compression = 92.5 percent
  - compressed bitfile size = 133288 bytes
